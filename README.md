# process_logs
#You need to generate a report from a legacy RADIUS accounting server. The server dumps usage logs into massive text files.
Write a Python script that:
#1. Reads the file safely (without crashing from Out-Of-Memory errors).
#2. Aggregates the total data usage per user.
#3. Prints the Top 5 Users by total usage.
